\section*{Response to Reviewers}

\subsection*{Reviewer \#1 Comments (from PDF):}

In this work, the authors extend the matrix approach of optical imaging they have been developing with other groups for the last few years to the context of dynamic scattering media. This topic is of great interest because matrix imaging has shown its great potential for overcoming multiple scattering in the long-standing quest towards deep imaging of complex media such as biological tissues. However, it relies by essence on the hypothesis of a static medium. Their approach relies on the fact that, under the isoplanatic hypothesis, dynamic scattering is mathematically analogous to dynamic illumination in static scattering media. From this analogy, they are then able to use the methods developed in previous papers [13] for scattering compensation under dynamic illumination in which the covariance matrix of the reflected wave-field was investigated rather than just the reflection matrix itself. This covariance matrix has already been recently leveraged to extend the scope of matrix imaging to incoherent (fluorescent) imaging by the authors themselves [14]. This paper is a new important demonstration of the versatility and the universality of matrix approaches to wave imaging in complex media. For incoherent imaging, the demonstration of the superiority of matrix imaging with respect to speckle correlation techniques [28,29] is convincing and might have deserved more publicity than just a short section in the Supplementary Material. For coherent imaging applications, the hypothesis of a constant incident wave-field is a bit contradictory with the problem of dynamic scattering and would deserve more discussion.  

As often with this group, this work is technically of excellent quality and its presentation is elegant. The experiments based on rotating diffusers are rather simple and allow the authors to illustrate nicely the concept. However, one can wonder whether the idea proposed by the authors can go beyond imaging through a thin dynamic diffusive layer and to which extent it can be applied to real 3D imaging situations like for biomedical or LiDAR applications. I detail below the main points that, in my opinion, would deserve more discussion before publication.

    \begin{ourresponse}
    We thank the Reviewer for their positive evaluation of our work, recognizing its significance in extending matrix-based imaging to dynamic scattering media and its potential impact.

        For instance, in the coherent imaging experiment depicted in Fig. 5, the approach requires a constant incident wave-field, which is complicated if one wants to image through a dynamic scattering medium. In the present experiment, the authors circumvent this issue by focusing the incident wave-field in the diffuser plane such that the beam waist is contained in one coherence length of the diffuser. However, in practical situations, the scattering medium is three-dimensional, and the condition of a constant incident wave-field becomes impossible to fulfill. In real life, dynamic scattering impacts both the incident and reflected wave-fields. The authors do not discuss really this apparent contradiction between the assumption of a constant incident wave-field and dynamic scattering that will break this invariance.

    \end{solved_reviewercomment}
    \begin{ourresponse}
    We appreciate the reviewer's observation about the apparent contradiction between dynamic scattering and our requirement for constant illumination in the coherent imaging experiment (Fig. 5). 
    
    In our coherent demonstration, we circumvented this challenge by focusing the illumination beam onto a small area of the diffuser (smaller than its correlation length), effectively sampling only a single "phase patch" as the diffuser rotates. However, we recognize this approach is not feasible for volumetric scattering media where maintaining constant illumination becomes challenging.
    
    To address this limitation transparently in our manuscript, we have added the following clarification:
    
    "For coherent imaging through dynamic scattering, our current approach is limited to scenarios where effectively constant illumination can be maintained at the object plane. While demonstrated here with a thin diffuser, volumetric scattering presents additional challenges that require further development."
    
    Beyond this manuscript revision, we propose a hybrid approach that could extend our method to volumetric dynamic media without requiring focused illumination:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item For each realization of the dynamic scatterer, rapidly acquire multiple ($K \gg 1$) holograms under different speckle illuminations (created with an additional diffuser in the illumination path)
        \item Use coherence gating on each individual hologram to determine the correct object depth and eliminate unwanted reflections
        \item Incoherently sum the intensity patterns to create "macro-frames": $I_m(x,y,z=z_{obj}) = \sum_{k=1}^{K}|E_{m,k}(x,y,z=z_{obj})|^2$ 
        \item Process these macro-frames using I-CLASS as in our incoherent experiments
    \end{enumerate}
    
    This protocol creates effectively uniform illumination through incoherent summing (as in the incoherent experiment with the rapidly rotating diffuser in the illumination path) while preserving the depth-selectivity and reflection-filtering advantages of coherent light. Each resulting macro-frame follows $I_m = P_m * O$, making the problem mathematically equivalent to our incoherent imaging scenario.
    
    Our current experimental demonstration served as a controlled environment to validate the fundamental principles of our approach. The hybrid method described above offers a promising path forward for complex volumetric media while maintaining the benefits of coherent imaging. Additionally, we highlight the applicability of our approach to advanced systems such as flexible multi-core fiber endoscopes (as demonstrated by Choi et al. [Flexible-type ultrathin holographic endoscope for microscopic imaging of unstained biological tissues]), where uniform illumination via single-mode excitation can be straightforwardly achieved.

        Another issue of three-dimensional scattering is that it breaks the isoplanatic assumption on which the current approach relies. The authors mention in the discussion the idea of mosaicking the field-of-view but it somehow requires a roughly focused incident wave-field and only applies to moderate scattering. Another route is a multi-conjugate adaptive optics scheme in which multiple scattering trajectories are rectified by compensating aberrations from a stack of phase screens conjugated with different planes inside the scattering medium [Kang et al., Nat. Commun., 2023]. Would the current approach proposed by the authors be compatible with such a multi-conjugate strategy? It might be relevant to discuss this point in the conclusion.
    \end{solved_reviewercomment}
    \begin{ourresponse}
        We thank the reviewer for highlighting this important limitation. We have demonstrated reconstruction through a thin scattering dynamic layer in our current work. The extension to thick scattering media represents an important challenge and direction for future research.
    
        In conventional CLASS or computational wavefront shaping, thick scatterers can be addressed by using multi-conjugate approaches with multi-layer scattering profiles. However, our approach presents a unique twist: in our formulation, the dynamic medium plays the role that would normally be occupied by the object in conventional CLASS implementations. This role reversal creates both challenges and opportunities.
        
        The modeling and treatment of thick targets proposed in the recent work by Park et al. [https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-025-56865-z] (Nature Communications, 2024) may offer a pathway forward. In that work, the authors developed techniques for handling thick objects rather than treating them as purely planar. Since in our case the dynamic medium mathematically functions as the "object," adapting these techniques could potentially allow us to extend our approach to volumetric scattering media.
    
        Additionally, another potential approach could be derived from the gradient-descent model-based algorithm recently developed by Haim et al. in their computational holographic wavefront shaping work \cite{haim2024image}. This method's flexibility in computational wavefront correction might offer alternative strategies for handling thick scattering media.
        
        We have added the following paragraph to the discussion section:
        
        "While we have focused our proof-of-principle demonstrations on isoplanatic scattering conditions, extending our approach to thick dynamic scattering media remains an important challenge. Recent advances in modeling thick targets rather than planar ones, such as those presented by Park et al., suggest potential pathways for adaptation to our scenario, where the dynamic medium mathematically plays the role of the object. Future work could explore combining our approach with multi-conjugate modeling, treating thick media as a series of thin scattering layers at different depths, each contributing its own phase and amplitude distortions to the overall scattering process."

    \begin{solved_reviewercomment}
        One last point which is not really discussed in the paper is the number of required independent frames \(M\) to converge towards a reliable estimation of the object or, in other words, the scaling of the estimator bias with respect to this number \(M\). An analytical formulation of the problem could be performed to derive this number, which is important for future implementations of the method. I guess this number will depend on the object complexity/sparsity.
    \end{solved_reviewercomment}
        

    \begin{ourresponse}

        We appreciate the reviewer's important question about the number of required independent frames for reliable estimation. To address this systematically, we conducted a set of numerical simulations investigating the relationship between reconstruction quality, number of realizations (M), and object sparsity. 

        The theoretical foundation of CTR-CLASS, as established in previous work by Lee et al., indicates a logarithmic dependence of the required number of measurements on the degrees of freedom (i.e., the number of camera pixels $N$). However, this theoretical scaling is modified in practice by additional factors including object complexity (sparsity) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). These factors play crucial roles in determining the practical minimum number of frames needed for successful reconstruction.

        We have added a new supplementary section ("Dependence of Reconstruction Quality on Number of Realizations and Object Sparsity") that addresses this question.
        
        % \hlred{Take from I-CLASS / Acusto-optic the paragraph about the theoretical dependence on M which is logarithmic (from the CTR paper) and add that there are additional factors to this theory such as the object complexity and SNR}.

            % \hlred{I suggest inserting something about how statistical siginficant is this result? how many experiments are in each heatmap cell? and what is the std between expereimnts (you have 3 random variables, the random object, the shot noise and the PSFs, maybe freeze 2 each time and run it to understand if they have the same effect}.

            
            To study the dependence of the reconstruction quality on the number of realizations and object complexity (sparsity), we numerically simulate the reconstructions at a varying number of random realizations (M) for different object complexities (sparsity) for incoherent and coherent imaging modalities.
            The results of the simulation for varying SNR values at an object sparsity are given in Figure Fig.~\ref{fig:convergence_heatmaps}
            To ensure statistical robustness, each data point in these heatmaps represents the average outcome from 10 independent numerical experiments.

            \end{minipage}

            These results demonstrate that sparser objects can be reconstructed with fewer realizations, while complex objects need substantially more measurements. Higher SNR conditions predictably improve reconstruction quality, and coherent imaging appears to require more measurements than incoherent imaging for equivalent fidelity.

        The supplementary Section S2 that shows the impact of correlations between speckle patterns is very interesting and might have deserved a place in the main manuscript. In this Supplementary Section, these correlations arise from energy conservation (phase-distortions). Maybe a singular value (or equivalently eigenvalue) decomposition of the covariance matrix [10] can help in that case? The first singular vector would be less affected by these negative correlations than the CLASS algorithm. Can the authors comment on that?

It would be interesting to study whether a singular value decomposition (SVD) of the covariance matrix [10] can help to address these effects?  In this work,  we have heuristically addressed this issue by applying a modulation to the total energy of captured images during post-processing, which effectively mitigates the observed correlation artifacts (see Supplementary Figure S2).

            Our analysis revealed that energy conservation in phase-only speckle patterns introduces troublesome spatial correlations that can cause background haze in the reconstructions.

        The authors show how to circumvent this issue by a multiplication of each frame by a fixed scalar value. This is interesting, but the choice of the multiplication factor from one to two lacks justification. Can the authors provide more details about this choice? 
    \end{solved_reviewercomment}

\begin{ourresponse}
We thank the reviewer for this question about our choice of multiplication factors. To address this, we conducted a systematic study examining how different modulation depths affect reconstruction quality.

We have added a new section to the Supplementary Materials titled "Effect of Modulation Depth on Reconstruction Quality" that demonstrates this trade-off. Here is the full section:

\begin{quote}
\section{Effect of Modulation Depth on Reconstruction Quality}

As discussed in Supplementary Section S2, energy conservation introduces off-diagonal correlations in the covariance matrix that can degrade reconstruction quality. We addressed this by applying variable intensity scaling across the captured frames, with multiplication factors linearly varying from 1 to 2 across frames.

To investigate the optimal range for this modulation, we conducted a study examining how different modulation depths affect reconstruction quality. For each depth value, we applied a linear scaling to our experimental data where the multiplication factor for the $m$-th frame (out of $M$ total frames) was:

\begin{equation}
    f_m = 1 + \frac{m-1}{M-1} \cdot (\alpha -1) = 1, 2, 3, ..., \alpha
\end{equation}

where $\alpha$ controls the total range of modulation with corresponding modulation depth $\frac{\alpha-1}{\alpha+1}$.

\begin{comment}
    We can rewrite this equation directly in terms of the modulation depth $d$ by solving for $\alpha$:

    \begin{align}
    d &= \frac{\alpha-1}{\alpha+1} \\
    d(\alpha+1) &= \alpha-1 \\
    d\alpha + d &= \alpha - 1 \\
    d\alpha - \alpha &= -1 - d \\
    \alpha(d-1) &= -1 - d \\
    \alpha &= \frac{-1-d}{d-1} = \frac{1+d}{1-d}
    \end{align}

    Substituting this into our original equation:
    
    \begin{align}
    f_m &= 1 + \frac{m-1}{M-1} \cdot \left(\frac{1+d}{1-d} - 1\right) \\
    &= 1 + \frac{m-1}{M-1} \cdot \frac{1+d-(1-d)}{1-d} \\
    &= 1 + \frac{m-1}{M-1} \cdot \frac{2d}{1-d}
    \end{align}
    
    Therefore, the multiplication factor for the $m$-th frame in terms of modulation depth $d$ is:
    
    \begin{equation}
        f_m = 1 + \frac{m-1}{M-1} \cdot \frac{2d}{1-d}
    \end{equation}

Our results show that without adding a modulation (modulation depth = 0), the reconstructions display a significant background haze. As modulation increases, this background haze diminishes progressively. However, at very high modulation depths, while the background continues to reduce, the contrast is somewhat lowered, which may be the result of a imperfect estimation of the MTF in the I-CLASS algorithm.  Modulation depths of 0.3-0.5 used in our main experiments provide an effective trade-off between these competing effects. %However, depending on specific application requirements, users might prefer different modulation depths to prioritize either background cleanliness or internal object clarity.
Additional improvements of this point can will be the focus of future work.

%Our results show that without adding a modulation (modulation depth = 0), reconstructions display a significant background haze. As modulation increases, this background haze diminishes progressively. However, at higher modulation depths, the reconstruction of I-CLASS does not correct the scattering PSF, as the amount of independent realizations diminishes.

            \label{Fresnel_propagation}
            In Fig.~\ref{fig5}, we present the object field located at the physical object plane, $z_{\text{obj}}$. However,\hlred{Add something like: 'since we measure the field on the diffuser plane...} the I-CLASS algorithm reconstructs the complex field in the plane of the scattering layer, denoted as $E_o(x, y, z_{\text{scatt}})$. To visualize the field at the object plane, we propagate the reconstructed field from the diffuser plane to the object plane using Fresnel propagation under the paraxial approximation.
            
            This propagation is efficiently implemented in the Fourier domain using the Fresnel transfer function:
            
            \begin{equation}
                E_o(x, y, z_{\text{obj}}) = \mathcal{F}^{-1} \left\{ \tilde{E}_o(f_x, f_y, z_{\text{scatt}}) \cdot H(f_x, f_y; \Delta z) \right\}
            \end{equation}
            
            where:
            - $ \tilde{E}_o(f_x, f_y, z_{\text{scatt}}) = \mathcal{F}\{ E_o(x, y, z_{\text{scatt}}) \} $ is the 2D Fourier transform of the reconstructed field,
            - $ H(f_x, f_y; \Delta z) $ is the Fresnel transfer function,
            - $ \Delta z = z_{\text{obj}} - z_{\text{scatt}} $ is the propagation distance,
            - $ \mathcal{F} $ and $ \mathcal{F}^{-1} $ denote the 2D Fourier and inverse Fourier transforms.
            
            The Fresnel transfer function in terms of spatial frequency is:
            
            \begin{equation}
                H(f_x, f_y; \Delta z) = \exp\left[ i \frac{2\pi \Delta z}{\lambda} \right] \cdot \exp\left[ -i \pi \lambda \Delta z (f_x^2 + f_y^2) \right]
            \end{equation}
            
            Here:
            - $ \lambda $ is the illumination wavelength,
            - $ (f_x, f_y) $ are the spatial frequency coordinates corresponding to the real-space axes $ (x, y) $.
            
            This formulation supports forward and backward propagation by simply changing the sign of $ \Delta z $, and is especially suitable for numerical implementation via Fast Fourier Transforms.

        In conventional CLASS/I-CLASS implementations, the output of the algorithm is the scattering layer function at the pupil of the optical system, that is, at the Fourier plane of the target. CLASS algorithms specifically look for correlations in the k-space, where the reflection matrix becomes diagonal         \hlred{the reflection matrix is definitely not diagonal...  }
 under the isoplanatic approximation and outputs the phase mask in this space.
        
        In our work, the roles are reversed: the object plays the role of the scattering medium. Consequently, the I-CLASS "scattering function" output is effectively the object function in k-space. This is why our reconstruction naturally occurs in the plane corresponding to the scattering layer.

        This approach creates no fundamental limitation for our imaging capability. Since we recover the complete complex wavefront, we can numerically propagate it to any desired axial plane using Fresnel propagation, as detailed in the Methods section.

\subsection*{Reviewer \#2 Comments (from email):}

In this manuscript the authors propose to use the I-CLASS algorithm (which was developed in the same group) to deconvolve the unknown object from the (many) unknown point spread function measured through a dynamic scattering medium. This builds on a previous paper from the same group (ref 14, as far as I can see still unpublished).

\textbf{Does the approach works?} Yes, the results in Fig. 2 alone are convincing enough.

\textbf{Are the result novel?} Yes. The algorithm itself is not new, but its application is.

\textbf{Is the paper written in a way such that somebody knowledgeable in optics but not an ultra-specialist in imaging through scattering media will be able to replicate the results and build up on them?} Not really.

                "\textbf{Note:} The matrix-based imaging approach demonstrated here highlights the fundamental principle of imaging through dynamic scattering media.

        \end{solved_reviewercomment}

        \begin{ourresponse}
            We thank the reviewer for this insightful question regarding the determination of the correct propagation distance. While the I-CLASS algorithm initially reconstructs the complex field at the scattering layer plane, a key advantage of our coherent imaging approach is that once we have retrieved the complex wavefront, we can numerically propagate it to any desired axial plane.
            
            This "digital autofocus" capability is a fundamental strength of coherent computational imaging. As we now explain in detail in the Methods section titled "Fresnel Propagation via Fourier-Domain Transfer Function," we use the Fresnel propagation transfer function to computationally propagate the reconstructed field from the diffuser plane to any desired plane, including the object plane.
            
            This numerical propagation capability allows us to determine the correct object plane computationally by finding the propagation distance at which the target features achieve optimal focus—eliminating the need for precise a priori knowledge of the object-diffuser distance during data acquisition. This is analogous to the focusing capability in digital holographic microscopy but applied to imaging through scattering media.
            
            To comprehensively address this point, we have added Supplementary Movie S3, which shows the continuous evolution of the reconstructed field as it is propagated from the diffuser plane through the optimal focus plane and beyond. We have also created a new supplementary section titled "Digital Autofocus through Fresnel Propagation" that demonstrates this capability in detail, which we reproduce below for the reviewer's convenience:
        
            \begin{quote}
                \section*{Digital Autofocus through Fresnel Propagation}
                
                In holographic imaging through scattering media, a key advantage is the ability to numerically propagate the reconstructed complex field to any desired axial plane once the field is retrieved at a single reference plane. This capability, often called digital autofocus, eliminates the necessity of knowing the exact object distance during data acquisition.
                
                In our experiments from Fig.~5 of the main text, the I-CLASS algorithm reconstructs the complex wavefront at the scattering layer plane (z = 0). However, as shown in Fig.~S6, this field can be digitally propagated to any desired plane using the Fresnel propagation operator described in the Methods section of the main text. 
                
                By computationally varying the propagation distance and observing the resulting reconstructed intensity distributions, we can identify the optimal object plane where the finest features of the target come into focus. This process is analogous to the physical process of adjusting the focus in a conventional microscope, but performed entirely in post-processing.
                
                Figure~S6 demonstrates this capability by showing the reconstructed field intensity at three distinct propagation distances: before the object plane (z = 5.3 cm), at the object plane where optimal focus is achieved (z = 7.15 cm), and after the object plane (z = 9 cm). The sharp focus observed at z = 7.15 cm confirms that this is indeed the correct object plane, with clear resolution of the fine features in the USAF target.
                
                For a more comprehensive demonstration of this digital autofocus capability, we refer readers to Supplementary Movie S3, which shows the continuous evolution of the reconstructed field as the propagation distance is varied from the diffuser plane (z = 0) to beyond the object plane.

            I am not sure I understand how focussing the illumination on the scattering medium can reduce the fluctuations of \(E^{\text{ill}}_m\). Wouldn't it actually maximise them?    
        \end{solved_reviewercomment}
        \begin{ourresponse}
        We thank the reviewer for this insightful question about an important aspect of our experimental design.
        
        The reviewer's intuition that focusing on a scattering medium might maximize illumination fluctuations is valid for many scenarios. However, in our specific configuration, the opposite effect occurs due to a crucial relationship between the illumination spot size and the correlation length of the diffuser.
        
        To address this question comprehensively, we have added a new section ("Effect of illumination spot size on coherent imaging through dynamic scattering") to the supplementary material with numerical simulations demonstrating this effect. For completeness, we reproduce the full section below:
        \begin{quote}
            \section*{Effect of illumination spot size on coherent imaging through dynamic scattering}
        
        In our coherent imaging configuration (Fig. 5 of the main text), maintaining a constant illumination pattern at the object plane despite the dynamic scattering introduced by the rotating diffuser is crucial for successful application of our reconstruction algorithm. As expressed in Eq. 6-7 of the main text, our method requires that the illumination field $E_m^{ill}(\vec{r})$ remains effectively constant across different acquisitions for our method to work properly.
        
        This requirement might appear contradictory, as one might expect that any illumination passing through a dynamic scatterer would inevitably result in varying illumination patterns. However, the key insight is that the relationship between the illumination spot size on the diffuser and the diffuser's correlation length determines whether the illumination at the object plane remains approximately constant between different diffuser realizations.
        
        \begin{minipage}{\linewidth}
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.85\textwidth]{figures/figure_S7.pdf}
        \captionof{figure}{\footnotesize \textbf {Effect of illumination spot size on imaging through dynamic scattering.} Numerical simulations demonstrating how the ratio of illumination spot size to diffuser correlation length affects illumination at the object plane and reconstruction quality. Each column represents a different spot size ratio: 0.1 (left), 1 (middle), and 10 (right). \textbf{a-c} Illumination phase pattern on the diffuser surface. The colorbar indicates phase values from $-\pi$ to $\pi$. The white inset in (a) shows the zoomed-in beam spot. \textbf{d-f} Resulting intensity patterns at the object plane after numerical propagation through the diffuser. The grayscale colorbar indicates normalized intensity. \textbf{g-i} Effective object (target object multiplied by the illumination pattern). \textbf{j-l} Reconstructed images after applying the I-CLASS algorithm. Note how a small spot size relative to the diffuser correlation length (left column) maintains relatively uniform illumination at the object plane, enabling high-quality reconstruction, while larger spot sizes (middle and right columns) create varying speckle patterns that degrade reconstruction quality.}
        \end{minipage}
        
        Fig. S7 demonstrates this principle through numerical simulation. The top row (Fig. S7a-c) shows the phase pattern of the diffuser with the illumination spot superimposed for three cases: where the spot size is 0.1, 1, and 10 times the diffuser correlation length ($d_{\text{correlation}}$), respectively. The second row (Fig. S7d-f) shows the resulting illumination intensity pattern at the object plane after the light has propagated through the diffuser, simulated using Fourier transform propagation.
        
        When the illumination spot is much smaller than the diffuser correlation length (Fig. S7a), it effectively samples only a single "phase patch" of the diffuser. As the diffuser rotates between realizations, this results in a relatively uniform illumination at the object plane that experiences only a global phase shift but maintains its spatial intensity pattern across different realizations. This consistency across different diffuser positions is crucial for our method to work properly. In other words, while the global phase of the illumination might change, its spatial distribution pattern remains effectively identical from one diffuser position to the next, satisfying our requirement for constant spatial illumination.
        
        In contrast, when the illumination spot size is comparable to or larger than the diffuser correlation length (Fig. S7c), the beam simultaneously samples multiple uncorrelated regions of the diffuser. This produces complex speckle patterns at the object plane that vary significantly between diffuser positions, creating a different illumination pattern for each diffuser realization. This variation violates our assumption of constant illumination in Eq. 6-7 of the main text.
        
        The third row (Fig. S7g-i) shows the effect of these illumination patterns on the effective object (the product of the object and the illumination), while the fourth row (Fig. S7j-l) shows the reconstruction results. The reconstruction quality clearly degrades as the spot size increases relative to the diffuser correlation length, demonstrating the critical importance of maintaining consistent illumination across different diffuser realizations.
        
        In our experimental implementation described in the main text, we carefully focused the beam to ensure a spot size smaller than the diffuser's correlation length ($\approx 70 \mu m$), thereby maintaining nearly constant spatial illumination patterns at the object plane across different realizations, with variations limited primarily to global phase shifts.

            the reason is that this is not standard phase-retrieval but phase-retrieval of speckle correlation imaging experiment: in a standard phase-retrieval the algorithm is run on the real power spectrum on the object (or equivalently the exact fourier-transform autocorrelation of the object) calculated directly from the object, whereas in our case the phase retrieal is run on an ESTIMATE of the object’s autocorrelation from the speckle correlation. In particular, for speckle correlation imaging to work, the speckled PSF autocorrelation has to resemble a highly-peaked delta-like function. This is the case ONLY when the PSF contains an exteremly large number of speckles, since for a speckle field the autocorrelation peak to background ratio is proportional to the number of speckles contained in the PSF. This practically requires the cpatured scatterd light image to contain a number of speckles that is considerably larger than the number of bright resolution cells in the target, which is not the case in our experiemnts and simulations
